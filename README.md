# encrypto-decrypto
Repo for encryption and decryption purposes

It's still in development and this by far is not close to over
but if you want to use any of the files in it feel free to download/copy them 
this project is open-src and is made using Python 3.

Be noted though. It will take a lot of time becuase I'm the only one in this project and I don't have much experiance in the Python language, so I'll be working on it as hard as I could.
Thank You!
